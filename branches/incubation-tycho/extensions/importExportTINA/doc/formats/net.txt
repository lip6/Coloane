
.net Format:
------------

A  net is  described  by a  series  of declarations  of places  and/or
transitions, and an  optional naming declaration for the  net. The net
described is the superposition  of these declarations.  The grammar of
.net  declarations  is  the   following,  in  which  nonterminals  are
bracketed by <  ..  >, terminals are in upper  case or quoted.  Spaces,
carriage return and tabs act as separators.

Optionally,  labels may be  assigned to  places and  transitions. This
should  be preferably done  within "tr"  and "pl"  declarations rather
than using separate  "lb" declarations. The later form  ("lb") is kept
for backward compatibility and might disappear in future releases.

.net			::= (<trdesc>|<pldesc>|<lbdesc>|<prdesc>|<netdesc>)*
netdesc			::= 'net' <net>
trdesc			::= 'tr' <transition> {":" <label>} {<interval>} {<tinput> -> <toutput>}
pldesc 			::= 'pl' <place> {":" <label>} {(<marking>)} {<pinput> -> <poutput>}
lbdesc			::= 'lb' [<place>|<transition>] <label>
prdesc			::= 'pr' (<transition>)+ ("<"|">") (<transition>)+
interval 		::= ('['|']')INT','INT('['|']') | ('['|']')INT','w['
tinput			::= <place>{<arc>}
toutput			::= <place>{<normal_arc>}
pinput			::= <transition>{<normal_arc>}
poutput			::= <transition>{arc}
arc			::= <normal_arc> | <test_arc> | <inhibitor_arc> |
			    <stopwatch_arc> | <stopwatch-inhibitor_arc> 
normal_arc		::= '*'<weight>
test_arc		::= '?'<weight>
inhibitor_arc		::= '?-'<weight>
stopwatch_arc		::= '!'<weight>
stopwatch-inhibitor_arc	::= '!-'<weight>
weight, marking 	::= INT{'K'|'M'}
net, place, transition, label 	::= ANAME | '{'QNAME'}'
INT			::= unsigned integer
ANAME			::= alphanumeric name, see Notes below
QNAME			::= arbitrary name, see Notes below

Notes:
  Two forms are admitted for net, place and transition names:
  - ANAME : any non empty string of letters, digits, primes ''' and underscores '_'
  - '{'QNAME'}' : any chain between braces, and in which characters '{', '}', and '\'
	are prefixed by '\'
  Empty lines and lines beginning with '#' are considered comments.
  In any closed temporal interval [eft,lft], one must have eft <= lft.
  The letter 'K' (resp. 'M') following a weight or marking multiplies it by 10^3 (resp. 10^6).
  Weight is optional for normal arcs, but mandatory for test and inhibitor arcs
  By default:
  - transitions have temporal interval [0,w[
  - normal arcs have weight 1
  - places have marking 0
  - places and transitin have the empty label "{}"
  When several labels are assigned to some node, only the last assigned is kept.
