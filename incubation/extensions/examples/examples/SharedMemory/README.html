                <h1>Description of the «SharedMemory» model</h1>
                <br>
                This description text is taken from 2011 Model checking contest organized as part of <a href="http://sumo.lip6.fr">SuMo</a> workshop, a satellite of the Petri Nets conference.<br>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph_style_1">This model is an example extracted from <a title="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/conf/pnpm/ChiolaF89" href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/conf/pnpm/ChiolaF89">here</a>. It models a system composed of P processors, each one with a local memory. Each processor can access its local memory using a dedicated local bus and the other memories using a unique shared bus. The processor accessing a remote memory have priority on those accessing their own memory. It is assumed that external access request causes preemption of the owner processor eventually accessing its local memory.<br></p>

                <h2>Scale factor</h2>

                <p class="paragraph_style_1">The scale factor is the number processors (size of color domain P). Proposed instances of this models contain the following numbers: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000.<br></p>
                <br>                Note that in fact the Scalar Set solution can be used for this model, and that Log performance is reached, allowing to model-check this system for 50000 participants in a few seconds with limited memory requirements.
